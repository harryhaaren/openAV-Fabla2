 * The Pad class is a collection of resources that apply to this pad. As multiple
 * samples can be hosted on one pad, it is essential to have a clean structure to
 * maintain these resources. The Pad class takes care of this.
 *
 * Multiple samples are contained here, as well as the necessary options to play
 * them back: round-robin or velocity mapped? Both?
 *
 * The Library class loads / saves data from the Pads, providing a clean method
 * to interact with the Pad contents in an RT-safe way.
